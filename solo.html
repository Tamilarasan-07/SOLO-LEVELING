        <h3>
            In a world where hunters — human warriors who possess supernatural abilities — must battle deadly monsters
            to protect all mankind from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jin-woo finds himself
            in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful
            double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System chooses him as
            its sole player and in turn, gives him the unique ability to level up in strength. This is something no
            other hunter is able to do, as a hunter's abilities are set once they awaken. Jinwoo then sets out on a
            journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the
            dungeons and the true source of his powers. He soon discovers that he has been chosen to inherit the
            position of Shadow Monarch, essentially turning him into an immortal necromancer who has absolute rule over
            the dead. He is the only Monarch who fights to save humanity, as the other Monarchs are all trying to kill
            him and wipe out the humansVoiced by: Taito Ban[6] (Japanese); Aleks Le[7] (English)
            Japanese name: Shun Mizushino (水篠 旬, Mizushino Shun)
            Sung Jin-woo (성진우; Seong Jinu) is the protagonist of the series. Originally a famously weak E-Rank Hunter,
            he gets the chance of a lifetime when he is selected as a Player by the System and is able to grow in
            strength without limit. Taking advantage of his new power, Jin-woo rises up to become far stronger than the
            National Level Hunters. Eventually, he learns that he became a Player because the Shadow Monarch Ashborn
            chose to train him as a successor to fight in the war between the Rulers and the Monarchs. He ultimately
            marries the S-Rank Hunter Cha Hae-in and has a son, Suho, who inherits some of his powers.
            In the sequel series Ragnarok, Jin-woo leaves Earth to join forces with the Rulers in a new war against the
            Itarim, beings who seek to take over the universe, but not before sealing Suho's memories and powers so he
            can live a normal life. When the Itarim's invasions eventually reach Earth, he tasks Beru to unseal Suho's
            memories and powers and train him to defend Earth from the new war.

        Sung Il-hwan (성일환; Seong Ilhwan) is a Korean S-Rank Hunter, Kyung-hye's husband, and Jin-woo and Jin-ah's
        father. Ten years before the events of the main storyline, he suddenly disappeared inside a dungeon and was
        presumed dead. He later returns to the human world to aid his son in the coming war against the Monarchs and is
        eventually revealed to be a Rulers' vessel, one of the seven humans chosen by the Rulers to serve as their
        hosts. Although Il-Hwan ultimately succeeds in his mission, he ends up exerting far more power than his body can
        handle and consequently dies in his son's arms. He is revived by Jin-woo when he uses the cup of reincarnation
        to create a new timeline. With his Ruler's authority, he is able to retain his previous memories from the
        previous timeline. However, he requests the Rulers erase his memories so he won't be a burden to Jin-woo and
        lives as a simple husband and father for his family.

        sequel series Ragnarok, she mysteriously disappears at the same time of Jin-woo's departure to fight the Itarim,
